# CS5800-FinalProject: Sun-Optimized Routing for Solar-Powered Electric Vehicles

---

## Project Overview
This project applies concepts from shortest-path algorithms and optimization techniques to improve the routing of solar-powered electric vehicles. It aims to enhance efficiency by integrating solar exposure data and balancing energy consumption with travel time.

---

## Data Sources
This project uses the following data sources:

OpenStreetMap (OSM) – For road and navigation data.
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Solar Resource API – For solar exposure data.

## Instruction
This project should be running in the following order:
1. Run build_combined_graph.py
2. Run route_evaluation.py
3. When a figure is generated, close it to load the next figure.
